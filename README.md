# Expanded Singles Plugin for Craft CMS 3

<img width="500" src="https://verbb.io/uploads/plugins/expanded-singles/_800x455_crop_center-center/expanded-singles-social-card.png">

A simple plugin for Craft CMS that alters the Entries Index sidebar to list all Singles, rather than grouping them under a 'Singles' link.

## Download

While Craft 3 is still in beta, you'll need to use Composer to download and install the plugin.

1. Open your terminal and go to your Craft project:

        cd /path/to/project

2. Then tell Composer to load the plugin:

        composer require verbb/expanded-singles

3. In the Control Panel, go to Settings → Plugins and click the “Install” button for Expanded Singles.
