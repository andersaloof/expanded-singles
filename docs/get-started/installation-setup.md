# Installation & Setup

While Craft 3 is in beta, you'll need to install plugins with [Composer](https://github.com/craftcms/docs/blob/master/en/installation.md). If you've installed Craft 3, you should already know a bit about Composer.

To install Expanded Singles, follow the below instructions.

## Installation

1.  Open your terminal and go to your Craft project:

```
cd /path/to/project
```        

2.  Then tell Composer to load the plugin:

```    
composer require verbb/expanded-singles
```        

3.  In the Control Panel, go to Settings → Plugins and click the “Install” button for Expanded Singles.


## Setup

To edit settings, go to Settings → Expanded Singles.
